# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

## Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Claude Code! We welcome and appreciate all submissions. We especially look for submissions that: (a) are highly exemplary of effective best practices (and which you have actually used with teams or on your own); (b) are creative and innovative approaches to coding with Claude, or using the Claude Code interface in novel ways; (c) experiment with workflows that other Claude Code users might wish to try, and which provide good frameworks for things like blogging, testing, CI/CD, etc.

## How to Contribute

1. **You do not need to be the owner** of the repository or file you're submitting. We are not hosting or distributing any of these files, but linking to them. If you've found (or discovered) a useful Claude Code resource, we'd love to include it! (That being said, do not link to a secondary distribution of a source whose license prohibits redistribution.)

2. **Follow the PR template** when making your submission. This helps keep contributions organized and consistent. There are two ways to open a PR:

   - Fork this respository and create a new branch for your changes. Then, submit a pull request with your changes.
   - Use the GitHub web interface to edit the file directly, make a commit, and submit a pull request. (This will automatically create a fork if one doesn't exist.)

3. **Make sure the source is "awesome"** - this means that it meets all or some of the following criteria:

   - It provides genuine value to Claude Code users
   - It demonstrates innovative or exemplary usage patterns
   - It follows best practices for `CLAUDE.md` files or slash commands
   - It comes from a reputable or noteworthy source (high star count is a plus!)
   - It works with the latest, or most current, version of Claude Code

4. **Verify your submission** by checking that links work and content is formatted correctly (meaning, formatted exactly like the existing entries). We prefer permalinks to GitHub resources. These can be found by clicking on the file or directory in the repo and selecting the "Copy permalink" option from the dropdown.

5. **Submit your PR** and we'll review it as soon as possible.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Additions to the list should be made by editing the `README.md` file.
- Descriptions should be concise and informative, and convey what value the resource provides to Claude Code users, or potential use cases.
- Include proper attribution and links to original sources (prefer permalinks if linking to Github files).
- Follow the existing organization structure (add your entry to the appropriate category and in the appropriate alphabetical order).
- **[Workflows](README.md#workflows)** consist of two or more tightly coupled Claude Code resources that work together, or they may be a higher-level description of a particular Claude Code integration or usage pattern.
- **[Slash Commands](README.md#slash-commands)** should be named according to the name of the slash-command.
- **[CLAUDE.md files](README.md#claude-md-files)** should be named according to the repository they are associated with, although the hyperlink should point to the `CLAUDE.md` file itself.
- You may also add a new category to a section if you believe it is genuinely warranted.

## Badges

If a file comes from a particular GitHub repository, that repository may include a badge to show that it has been featured in the Awesome Claude Code list. The same applies to blogs, websites, etc. This is optional, but encouraged.

We aim to maintain a high-quality collection that helps the Claude Code community. Even small contributions can make a big difference!

Thank you for helping make Awesome Claude Code even more awesome!
